# Excelsior

The Safe and Easy Rust Web Ready-To-Go Archetype.

[Guides](https://medium.com/excelsiorTuto)

## Overview

Excelsior is a functional and readable repository to easily build a web service/API with the Rust language, built
basically with Tokio, Axum, and Tower libraries. And uses D.A.F.T. for folder organization.

## Usage

Make sure you have a full installation of the Rust compiler equal to or above version 1.87 on your machine. Each branch
in the "exp-pack" folder is an extra feature/example to add to your project.

1. Clone this code
2. Merge the branches you'll need
3. Create your new app

Some IDEs allow you to use a repository as a base to avoid cloning, see with your IDE.

## Contributing

Thanks for your help in improving the project! If you're willing to contribute, you'll have to follow several rules:

1. Create an Issue or a Pull Request
2. If you create a Pull Request, ensure you have followed the code model
3. Avoid unintelligible naming (like var a, b, method procedure_x)
4. Avoid theoretical code and variant typing (T), unless it's ULTRA necessary
5. Write a code that could be read by a junior Rust dev
6. Create the unit and integrated tests as needed

If you can't follow these rules, create an Issue and drop your code there, and I'll make it work.
Excelsior was created to be the "ready-made cake batter" for an API, not the cake recipe with the ingredients.

Before the code is merged, it will be tested in [ExcelsiorFull]. I like to ensure that all code works perfectly and is
integrated with all the other parts. After that, the code will be tested in the merge with the main Excelsior project.
